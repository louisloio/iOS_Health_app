# Revamp of iOS Health app.

The iOS Health app is an application made by apple to aggregate data from multiple connected objects. Into this article I will explain what is my process to improve the experience of an app. We will see this points:

* Identify the problem
* Define the scope of the problem
* The solution

## Identify the problem.
What are we trying to solve? In the past few weeks we collected a few feedback from users through different channel such as:

* Face to face interview.
* Feedback and article about the app.
* Online survey.

During our investigation staff members highlighted some topics and we used it to create this list of problems to fix:

> Users fund it's hard to read data into charts.

> Users fund it's hard to find daily data into summary.

> Users want more advise about how to manage their life style to improve the KPIs.

## The Scope.
What the problem is impacting and how will the stakeholders get around the problem?

Identify the scope of the project is important to understand stakeholders
behaviour. To realise this study we will create 3 graphical outputs:

### Users personas.
A persona represents a group of stakeholders who exhibit similar behaviours, it could be relative to their ages, where they from or a special attitude that make them different.

### Customer Journey.
This is the workflow which engage stakeholders before, during and after they try to accomplish their goal with the product. The idea is to understand what's will drive stakeholders to use your product and and how it will impact their life of everyday.

### Ecosystem map.
Basically ecosystem is a term used in biology, it describe the environment where animals, plants, bacteria etc.. evolve and interact together. We will apply this method into our stakeholder.

* The practices they perform,
* The information they use and share,
* The people with whom they interact,
* The services available to them,
* The devices they use, and
* The channels through which they communicate.

This key points allows to create an "ecosystem map" a graphical representation of all external interaction of the user when he try to achieve his goal.

Users express some troubles to read the content of the app and find what they want. So, I suggest to use dark theme for the app because it easiest to read complex data on dark. it allow to use more colours because the contrast ratio is higher.

Users express troubles to understand frequency of data so I choose to change name of the page from "summary" to "daily usage" to avoid confusion. it also engage users to check their data everyday.

I choose to group all favorite indicator into a carousel at the top of the page to simplify the navigation into the landing page.

The category "Get More From Health" will provide article to help users to have better understanding on how to analyse their data and also some articles about connected tools.
